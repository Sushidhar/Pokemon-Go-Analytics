# Pokemon-Go-Analytics
Pokemon Go! became a very famous augmented reality (AR) game in 2016 summer. In this project, we want to understand the success of the mobile app game. Specifically, the purposes of this project are (1) to do web scraping using BeautifulSoup, (2) to construct a Pandas dataframe, (3) to explore/visualize the numeric data using matplotlib or seaborn, and finally (4) to use sklearn to build machine learning models to predict the app’s review counts.  (5) analyze the app’s screenshot images using deep learning with tensorflow.
